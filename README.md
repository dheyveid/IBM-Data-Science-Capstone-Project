# IBM-Data-Science-Capstone-Project

This capstone project will ultimately predict if the Space X Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully.

This project follows these steps:

Data Collection
Making GET requests to the SpaceX REST API
Web Scraping
Data Wrangling
Using the .fillna() method to remove NaN values
Using the .value_counts() method to determine the following:
Number of launches on each site
Number and occurrence of each orbit
Number and occurrence of mission outcome per orbit type
Creating a landing outcome label that shows the following:
0 when the booster did not land successfully
1 when the booster did land successfully
Exploratory Data Analysis
Using SQL queries to manipulate and evaluate the SpaceX dataset
Using Pandas and Matplotlib to visualize relationships between variables, and determine patterns
Interactive Visual Analytics
Geospatial analytics using Folium
Creating an interactive dashboard using Plotly Dash
Predictive Analysis (Classification)
Using Scikit-Learn to:
Pre-process (standardize) the data
Split the data into training and testing data using train_test_split
Train different classification models
Find hyperparameters using GridSearchCV
Plotting confusion matrices for each classification model
Assessing the accuracy of each classification model
